## How to use?
- Install OpenCV `pip install opencv-python` and Numpy `pip install numpy`
- Download test image/video (You can find test image and video in Test folder in this repo)
- Comment `image_detection` if working with only video and vice versa
- Write path in the `loc` variable
- That's it!

### This is a very simple lane detection algorithm. Still working on it to make it better. All of your suggestions are welcome!!
